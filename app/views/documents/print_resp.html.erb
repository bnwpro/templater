	<h2>PRINT COMMUNICATIONS LEADER</h2>
	<p>The Print Communications Leader is responsible for producing various print and promotional materials used in the Capital Stewardship Campaign. This may be a "start to finish" process or a process that utilizes the print plan developed by the archdiocese.</p>
	<p>A basic print communications strategy may have been developed by the Communications Team of your archdiocese. This strategy may include:
		<ul>
			<li>Campaign theme-logo, title, and color scheme</li>
			<li>Letterhead and envelopes</li>
			<li>Fact Sheet explaining the campaign</li>
			<li>Commitment Cards</li>
			<li>Brochure [and additional communications pieces] to be included in an Information Packet</li>
			<li>Prayer Card with the Campaign Prayer</li>
			<li>Posters announcing the campaign</li>
			<li>Personal Commitment Guide/Devotional</li>
		</ul>
		[NOTE: these items are adjusted according to each archdiocesan campaign]
	</p>
	<p>The strategy and process for producing these items above are outlined in the Print Resource Guide. If you do not have such a guide, immediately request one through your Consultant.</p>
	<p>Depending on the strategic needs and opportunities in your parish, other print pieces (like additional newsletters) may be added to the basic strategy above. Check with your Consultant about the need for additional print pieces.</p>
